        <h1>Basix Core</h1>
        <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <div>
            Basix Core contains each very basics functions to use Basix, or that can be used in a C++ program.
        </div>
        <h2>
            Content
        </h2>
        <div>
            Basix Core has a lot of differents features, presented here.
            <h3>
                Debugging helper
            </h3>
            <div>
                Basix Core offers a little debugging tool, using "std::cout" to create a debugging output with the "print" function.
                The difference with a simple "std::cout" is the ability to target a special debugging.
                Indeed, to print datas, you should specify two things : the type and the sender of the data.
                Theses two things aren't subjects to any kinds of nomenclature, you can do literaly how you want.
                You can then tell Basix Core which type / sender can or cannot be printed, to target a part of the program to debug.
                To be more precise, the "print" function print the type, the sender, and the message, each separate by a editable std::string separation.
                You can also disable each "print" functions if you want.</br>
                As the authorized sender and type are stored in vector (see <a href="authorized_sender">authorized_sender()</a> and <a href="authorized_type">authorized_type()</a>), you can use this functions and base vecor functions to handle the authorisation.
                For exemple, use "basix::authorized_type().clear()" to clear the authorisation, and "basix::authorized_type().push_back("Test")" to add some other.</br>
                To do a quite big exemple, assuming you are developing a Mandelbrot set creator with an image, you may create two classes : "Complex" and "Mandelbrot_Creator".
                If your result is not what you are expecting, you can place some "print" functions, the one in the "Complex" class with the type "Complex", and the other one in the "Mandelbrot_Creator" class with the type "Mandelbrot_Creator".
                Then, you can tell Basix Core which type can or not be printed to see which part of the program is doing unexpected behaviors.
                You can do the same thing with the sender of the data.
