                SCLS Foundamental Math contains some (C++) functions made to execute (mathematicals) functions.</br>
                It has functions used in the image handling, like the "paeth_function".

                    <div>
                        Apply the paeth function to the "left", "above" and "upper_left" value.</br>

                Get mathematicals datas

            <div>
                If you want to get datas about something mathematicly, without any functions, SCLS Foundamental Math allows it.
                This functions are not hard to code at all, but it's a gain of time to have them already coded in SCLS.</br>
                You can normalize a value between two other values with "normalize_value".</br>
                You can get the sign of a double with the "sign" function.

                    <h5>
                        double normalize_value(double number, double min, double max)
                    </h5>
                    <div>
                        Return the double "number" normalized between "min" and "max" both included.</br>
                        This function is very similar to the "mod" function.</br>
                        if max is tinier than min, the 2 values are swapped. If max - min = 0, 0 is returned.

                    <div>
                        Return the sign of "number", -1 or 1.
