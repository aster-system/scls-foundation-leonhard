            <h3>What is Basix ?</h3>
            <div>
                Basix is a little C++ library, adding very basic but cumbersome features, missing from the C++ standart library.
                It's made to be simply used and simply readable for every users.
            </div>
            <h3>What to do with Basix ?</h3>
            <div>
                As mentionned in a <a href="#how_to_use">next part</a>, the license allows you to watch the code of the library.</br>
                If you're are new with C++, you can learn from this library.
                As the creator of the library, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you to watch the code and learn from it. It is made to be simple to read and user-friendly.</br>
                If you know well C++, you can watch the code too, but it's certainly not the better code you have watched in your life.
                You can change and upgrade it if you want. If you publish it, we would be strongly grateful if you could mention us, or contact us to make your upgrade an official upgrade.

            Each Basix functions / classes / ... uses the "basix" namespace, to be separate from the rest of your program and easily usable.</br>
            Basix is cutted in differents files, each ones having a specific usage. Some of this files need external libraries (for now).</br>
            Here a list of each files :</br>
            <ul>
                <li>basix.h : A file including every others files in the library.</li>
