        <h2>Presentation</h2>

            <h3>What is SCLS ?</h3>
            <div>
                SCLS, for "Simple C++ Libraries Set", is a sets of C++ library, which means to make C++ development <i>almost</i> as easy as in Python.
            </div>
            <h3>What is SCLS Foundamental ?</h3>
            <div>
                SCLS Foundamental is the core library of the Aster System SCLS project.
                It unites a lot of core functionnality to use each others SCLS libraries.</br></br>
                It is name "Leonhard", after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, also known as one of the "Father of the modern mathematics".

            <h3>What to do with SCLS Foundamental ?</h3>
            <div>
                As mentionned in a <a href="#how_to_use">next part</a>, the license allows you to watch the code of the library.</br>
                If you're are new with C++, you can learn from this library.
                As the creator of the library, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you to watch the code and learn from it. It is made to be simple to read and user-friendly.</br>
                If you know well C++, you can watch the code too, but it's certainly not the better code you have watched in your life.
                You can change and upgrade it if you want. If you publish it, we would be strongly grateful if you could mention us, or contact us to make your upgrade an official upgrade.

            Each SCLS Foundamental functions / classes / ... uses the "scls" namespace, to be separate from the rest of your program and easily usable.</br>
            SCLS Foundamental is cutted in differents files, each ones having a specific usage. Some of this files need external libraries (for now).</br>
