        <section>
            SCLS Foundamental Core contains each very basics functions to use SCLS Foundamental, or that can be used in a C++ program.
            It has a lot of differents features, presented here.
            They are quite different and not linked, but they are cool as well.

            Debugging helper
        </h2>
        <section>
            <article>
                SCLS Foundamental Core offers a little debugging tool, using "std::cout" to create a debugging output with the "print" function.
                The difference with a simple "std::cout" is the ability to target a special debugging.
                Indeed, to print datas, you should specify two things : the type and the sender of the data.
                Theses two things aren't subjects to any kinds of nomenclature, you can do literaly how you want.
                You can then tell SCLS Foundamental Core which type / sender can or cannot be printed, to target a part of the program to debug.
                To be more precise, the "print" function print the type, the sender, and the message, each separate by a editable std::string separation.
                You can also disable each "print" functions if you want.
                As the authorized sender and type are stored in vector (see <a href="authorized_sender">authorized_sender()</a> and <a href="authorized_type">authorized_type()</a>), you can use this functions and base vecor functions to handle the authorisation.
                For exemple, use "scls::authorized_type().clear()" to clear the authorisation, and "scls::authorized_type().push_back("Test")" to add some other.
                To do a quite big exemple, assuming you are developing a Mandelbrot set creator with an image, you may create two classes : "Complex" and "Mandelbrot_Creator".
                If your result is not what you are expecting, you can place some "print" functions, the one in the "Complex" class with the type "Complex", and the other one in the "Mandelbrot_Creator" class with the type "Mandelbrot_Creator".
                Then, you can tell SCLS Foundamental Core which type can or not be printed to see which part of the program is doing unexpected behaviors.
                You can do the same thing with the sender of the data.

            Datas structures manipulation
        </h2>
        <section>
            <article>
                SCLS Foundamental offers some usefull functions to manipulate some data structure, like std::string, std::vector, or char*.<br />
                There are in SCLS Foundamental some little usefull functions to do some simple std::string manipulation.
                You can check if an another std::string appears in a std::string with "contains", to count its number of occurence with "count", split a std::string with "cut_string" or join it with "join_string".
                You can also put an entire std::string to lowercase with "lowercase_string", replace a part of a std::string by an another std::string in "replace", convert a std::string to utf_8 with "to_utf_8" and convert a char array to a std::string with "char_array_to_string".
                However, if you aspire to use the "to_utf_8" function, read the documentation below before.<br />
                There are also some others usefull functions, like "swap_vector" which can swap a vector, or "swap_char_array" which san swap a char array.<br />
                If you want to convert a std::string to a double, the std library gives the "std::stod" function.
                But, with this function, in some computer, the separation between the integer part and the decimal is ".", and in others computer, it's ",".
                To be the most portable possible, SCLS Foundamental offers a function "string_to_double(std::string str)" which takes this in count to convert the std::string.
                It tests which character to use and which not to use, and replace it if necessary for the conversion.

                    Return a std::string in UTF-8, coming from a char array "character" of size "text_size" not already converted.<br />
                    IMPORTANT : during the test phase, multiples unexpected behaviors have been found. You should do some test to see if your compiler do not already use UTF-8 before using this function. Moreover, the console can't print properly a lot of characters, so using the scls::Image "text_image" function may be more appropriate to test it.<br />
