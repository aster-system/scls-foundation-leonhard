                SCLS Foundamental Math contains some (C++) functions made to execute (mathematicals) functions.&lt;/br&gt;
                It has functions used in the image handling, like the "paeth_function".

                    Apply the paeth function to the "left", "above" and "upper_left" value.

                If you want to get datas about something mathematicly, without any functions, SCLS Foundamental Math allows it.
                This functions are not hard to code at all, but it's a gain of time to have them already coded in SCLS.
                You can normalize a value between two other values with "normalize_value".
                You can get the sign of a double with the "sign" function.

                </h4>
                <div>
                    Return the double "number" normalized between "min" and "max" both included.
                    This function is very similar to the "mod" function.
                    if max is tinier than min, the 2 values are swapped. If max - min = 0, 0 is returned.<br />

                <div>
                    Return the sign of "number", -1 or 1.<br />
