            SCLS Foundamental File contains some basics but usefull functions to do some simple file editing with C++.
            It's not the most filled SCLS Foundamental.
            Indeed, the C++ std library <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem">filesystem</a> added in C++ 17 adds a lot of very usefull functions with files.
            This file adds some others simples functions, by using filesystem.

                SCLS Foundamental File adds some functions made to describe a file / directory.
                In fact, this functions are just some simplification of the filesystem functions, which are usefull in some cases.
                You can analyse easily a directory. The function "directory_content" allows a simple access to the sub-files of a directory.
                You can also have some basics informations about a file with "file_extension" which gives the extension and "file_name" which gives the name of the file.

                <div>
                    Return each sub-files's path of the directory "path" in a std::vector of std::string. If "sub_directory" is true, adds the sub-files of the sub-directories in "path".
                    If any kinds of error occurs, the returned std::vector is empty.

                    Return the extension of "path", with the point at the start if "with_point" is true.

                SCLS Foundamental File allows the user to read or write in a file, very very easily. It allows to do that in only one line of code.

                <div>
                    Reads the entire file "path", and returns it.
                    If any kinds of error occurs, "" is returned.<br />

                <div>
                    Erases or creates "path", then writes "to_write" in it. You can handle the mode of opening with "opening_mode".<br />
