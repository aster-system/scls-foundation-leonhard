                <h3>What is SCLS Foundation "Leonhard" ?</h3>
                <div>
                    SCLS Foundation "Leonhard" is the core library of the <a href="https://aster-system.github.io/aster-system/projects/scls.html">Aster System SCLS project</a>.
                    It unites a lot of core functionnality to use each others SCLS libraries.
                    It is name "Leonhard", after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, also known as one of the "Father of the modern mathematics".
                    For now, the library is at its version 0.1.

                <h3>What to do with SCLS Foundation "Leonhard" ?</h3>
                <div>
                    If you're are new with C++, you can learn from this library.
                    As the creator of the library, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you to watch the code and learn from it. It is made to be simple to read and user-friendly.
                    If you know well C++, you can watch the code too, but it's certainly not the better code you have watched in your life.
